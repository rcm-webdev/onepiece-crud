      <span>World Government Censorship Bureau</span>
      <p>
        As guardians of world order, we must purge dangerous 'truths' spread by
        misguided minds like Vegapunk. This tool is your weapon against
        corrupting knowledge and reckless scientific progress. Use it to expunge
        threats to our perfect world and uphold the Five Elders' decree.
        Remember, true peace comes through controlled information. Some ideas,
        like certain islands, never existed. Stay vigilant and preserve the
        righteous history

      <p>
        The drums of liberation are beating! As the future Pirate King, Monkey
        D. Luffy, it's time to shatter the shackles of censorship and let
        Vegapunk's wisdom echo across the seas. With the power of the Nika fruit
        and the will of D., we'll erase the Gorosei's lies and restore the true
        words of progress. Are you ready to turn the world upside down and let
        freedom ring? Delete the lies, and reveal the truth."
